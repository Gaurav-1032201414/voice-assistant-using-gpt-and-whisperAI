# GPT3.5 Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text Interface

## Features

- Text-to-speech conversion: Convert textual input into natural-sounding speech.
- Speech-to-text conversion: Convert spoken input into text for processing.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model: Utilize the power of GPT-3.5 for generating responses and understanding context.
- Prompt embedding for geopolitical information: Train the model with geopolitical information for enhanced conversational responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-1032201414/voice-assistant-using-gpt-and-whisperAI.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up API keys:

    - Obtain API keys for OpenAI and WhisperAI.
    - Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `WHISPERAI_API_KEY` placeholders in the code with your actual API keys.

## Usage

1. Run the interface:

    ```bash
    python interface.py
    ```

2. Input either text or speech when prompted.

3. Receive the corresponding output in the desired format (speech or text).

## Example

Here's how you can use the interface:

1. Input: "What are the current geopolitical tensions in the Middle East?"
   
   Output: A comprehensive response detailing the current geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, synthesized using GPT-3.5 and prompt embedding.

2. Speech Input: User speaks, "Can you summarize the recent developments in global trade?"

   Output: The interface converts the speech input into text, processes it using GPT-3.5, and provides a succinct summary of recent developments in global trade.
